* How to start using api's (https://restfulapi.net/introduction-to-json/)

### 11/2/25:
* Created a function named `fetchRandomQuote` and took some code to see how i would first obtain information from a server and have it show on a website that displayed this quote.
* I'm planning to get a server website that gives information because some sites are not working.
* So far i have a test website that should display a quote currently in progress.
* `https://forismatic.com/en/api/` is a site to see how an api works and using some examples for my testing.
